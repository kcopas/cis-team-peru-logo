# CIS Team Peru Logo
Files related to the development of a logo for Team Peru, a charity club at the Copenhagen International School. The logo was created in the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015 by student volunteers, Oscar Insua, Erin Yakiwchuk and Kyle Copas.

Typeface is [Red Five](http://www.fonthead.com/fonts/RedFive), a free slab serif font.

The mark combines elements of Dannebrog, the Danish national flag, and a simplified version of the golden sun on the [Peruvian flag of March 1822](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Peru#Flag_of_March_1822) and [May 1822](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Peru#Flag_of_May_1822). 

While earlier identity elements for Team Peru varied widely, the colour purple has provided one consistent thread.
